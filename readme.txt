The Location Slug:

To find your location slug just visit Eventfinda Austria, Australia, New Zealand or Singapore and navigate to the location you would like to display listings for.

The location slug is the last string in the url:

The location slug for the url above is "auckland-central".

[eventz-lite params="location_slug=auckland-central"]

The location slug can also be used for venues.

Visit Eventfinda and search for your venue, example “Henderson RSA”.

Events for this venue will be displayed with a link to the venue, for the above example the link is:

https://www.eventfinda.co.nz/venue/henderson-rsa-auckland-west

The location slug to enter for the above example is “henderson-rsa-auckland-west”.


The Category Slug:

To find the category slugs for your country visit your local Eventfinda site and click “Find Events” at the top of the page.

When the “Upcoming Events” page has loaded you will see the event categories listed underneath the locations.

Click the category you would like to display and get the category slug from the url:

http://www.eventfinda.co.nz/concerts-gig-guide/events/new-zealand

The category slug for the url above is "concerts-gig-guide".

[eventz-lite params="category_slug=concerts-gig-guide"]

The paramaters for “rows” & “offset” are taken care of by the plugin (results per page in the admin setup).
